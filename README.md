Welcome to my GitHub! It's a work in progress, but I'll be uploading some projects in the near future.

My intent is to build a portfolio here of side projects that I have been working on. Most of my time is spent on course projects, but I have a few personal ones I've been working on that showcase my coding abilities. Eventually, when my research becomes published, I'll be able to upload work related to that project (which I'm excited to share!).

I'm currently a graduate student and I'm on the hunt for a data science role. I'm skilled in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and C++. I enjoy using machine learning and statistical modeling to derive insights into questions I ask on a daily basis.
