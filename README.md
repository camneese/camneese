Welcome to my GitHub! It's a work in progress, but I'll be uploading some projects in the near future. 

My intent is to build a portfolio here of side projects that showcase my coding abilities. I enjoy using machine learning and statistical modeling to help answer the questions I ask on a daily basis. Among the personal projects I will be adding to my page are:
- Predicting how many points, rebounds, or assists an NBA player will have in an upcoming game (using web scraping, time series, Bayesian analysis, and Object Oriented Programming)
- Analyzing sentiments of sentences (with several NLP techniques of increasing sophisication)
- Facial recognition algorithm building (using a CNN, but also seeing how good I can get with more basic approaches like PCA + KNN)

My main coding language is Python. I'm skilled in R, SQL, C++, and SAS as well. Please see my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/camden-neese) for more details about my professional career.
